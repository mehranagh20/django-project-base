Virtual Environment
===
## Overview
> A Virtual Environment is a tool to keep the dependencies required by different projects in separate places, by creating virtual Python environments for them. It solves the “Project X depends on version 1.x but, Project Y needs 4.x” dilemma, and keeps your global site-packages directory clean and manageable.

Python has a virtual environment tool called virtualenv.

## Why bother using it?
Projects Dependencies become more and more complicated over time.

You may not feel needing a Virtual Environment tool at the first but over time, the bigger projects get and the more projects you involve in, it will feel like hell managing dependencies of projects.

A lot of these problems can be solved with a proper Virtual Environment tool like virtualenv.
